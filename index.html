					Straight to the Point Archery is an indoor training facility with  28 shooting (14 -  10 yard lanes and 14 â€“ 20 yard lanes) and 2 private coaching rooms. We also have access to 26  additional  20 yard lanes  and an outdoor shooting field.  We offer several types of lessons to accommodate everyone from the first time archer to the professional archer. Once set up with proper fitting equipment, each archer will be given the basic safety instruction to start and will be introduced to various shooting techniques.
